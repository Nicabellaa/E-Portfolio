            moments. My dream is to one day run my own wedding and event planning business where I can design 
            experiences that bring joy, beauty, and connection to others. I love the idea of creating unforgettable 
            memories for clients and turning their visions into reality. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <h2>My Desired Strengths</h2>
            <p>In the short term, I want to gain hands-on experience by interning with an event planning 
            team and learning every part of the process, while in the long term, my goal is to build my own successful
             event business that reflects my personal style and professionalism. My strengths include determination, 
             leadership, and organization, and I hope to continue growing my patience and adaptability as I pursue 
             this career.</p>

            <h2>Role Models</h2>
            <p>Listening to my TAs’ stories and hearing from class speakers who have built their own paths 
             in the hospitality field has truly inspired me. Their experiences remind me that success takes hard work,
              creativity, and passion, all qualities I strive to embody as I work toward my dream of becoming an independent 
              wedding and event planner.</p>
