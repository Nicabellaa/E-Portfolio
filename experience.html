            <h2>American Legion Auxiliary Girls State — Citizen</h2>
            <h3>Summer 2024</h3>
            <p> Qualified high school juniors take part in a week-long government workshop, becoming citizens of a 
                mythical 51st state in which they study local, county, and state political and governmental processes. <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                They elect their own officials (county representatives, judges, members of the legislature, state leadership),
                organize two parties (Nationalists and Federalists),
                write, present, and debate bills, and
                carry out the duties of the office to which they are elected/appointed. <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                This educational program is designed to provide a practical perspective on government structure and operation 
                where the individual is an integral part of, and responsible for, the character and success of her government.
